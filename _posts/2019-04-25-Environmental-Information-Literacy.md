Environmental Information Literacy
===============

As an undergraduate I petitioned the University of Illinois Board of Trustees to divest their endowment from fossil fuels. That campaign and experience fostered a life-long love of working with the public, which eventually led me to pursue a career in librarianship. Although my work now is no longer focused on educating the public about the dangers of fossil fuel consumption, being back on the same campus where I was involved in a deep community of environmental activism has led me to think critically about how those experiences inform my goals in librarianship.  A few months ago, I had my “aha” moment when I watched an archived keynote address Eira Tansey gave at the 2017 NDSA Conference. In it, she lays out the most convincing case I have heard for the role of LAM institutions in protecting the environment. 

Other than completely geeking out about the incredible role librarians played in the creation of Rachel Carson’s *Silent Spring*, I was struck by the very valuable role Tansey presents information professionals have as stewards of the environment; she argues that in these uncertain political times, we, as information professionals, need to safeguard the continued collection and preservation of environmental data that make environmental activism possible. However, in my opinion, I think it is just as important to provide our communities the tools to access, interpret, and use environmental data, statutes, and other information to be stewards of their environment, or in other words, promote “environmental information literacy.” 
When working on environmental issues, I learned these skills through a combination of mentors, peers, and coursework in the environmental sciences. Despite the fact that libraries and librarians are incredible resource for data literacy skills, government documents and information, I would have never turned to my library for assistance, in part because I did not view these pursuits as “scholarly” or “serious.” However, within the past few years, libraries have increasingly adopted innovative information literacy programs like data literacy workshops and citizen science initiatives. Within these initiatives, there is improved opportunities for our communities to view libraries as a source for environmental information. If we provide workshops on understanding U.S. Census data, how to code or give a business pitch, why not provide resources for using E.P.A. data, monitoring your own water quality, or testifying at municipal hearings?

In our current moment of extreme environmental degradation, it can be quite easy to lose sight of our role in creating a more livable planet. However, Bill McKibben recently argued, “we’re capable of acting together to do remarkable things” and I believe equipping our communities with the skills to both understand and advocate for their local environment can play and incredibly important role in accomplishing the remarkable things necessary at this moment.
